# GitHub PR Codex Review Loop

## Overview

Run a deterministic loop for PR hardening:
1. Check whether Codex already reacted with `:+1:`.
2. If not approved, gather Codex-authored feedback.
3. Implement fixes, run validations, commit, and push.
4. Repeat every 30 seconds until approval is present.

Use GitHub CLI (`gh`) for all GitHub operations.

## Required Inputs

- PR number or PR URL.
- Repository slug (`owner/repo`) when working outside the checked-out repo.
- Optional Codex actor names when your organization uses a custom bot identity.

## Loop Workflow

1. Check approval signal:
```bash
node scripts/check_codex_thumbs_up.js 123 --repo owner/repo
```
2. Stop immediately if `approved=true`.
3. Collect Codex feedback context:
```bash
node scripts/collect_codex_feedback.js 123 --repo owner/repo --format markdown
```
4. Branch on the result:
   - If actionable feedback exists, address it in a single coherent fix set.
   - If approval is absent and no actionable feedback exists yet, emit a short status update, wait 30 seconds, and return to step 1. Do not exit the loop.
5. Run required project validations before commit.
6. Stage and commit without delay after staging:
```bash
git add <changed-files>
git commit -m "fix: address codex PR feedback"
git push
```
7. Resolve addressed review threads:
   - Inspect unresolved threads with `gh api graphql` query from `references/gh-review-loop-reference.md`.
   - Resolve only threads fully addressed by the push.
8. After each push, emit a short status update, wait 30 seconds, and return to step 1.
9. Repeat from step 1 until approval is detected.

## Validation Rules

- Stop the loop only on explicit `:+1:` reaction by a Codex actor.
- Do not claim success when feedback is missing but approval is absent.
- Treat `approved=false` with no new feedback as a non-terminal state; wait 30 seconds and keep polling.
- Emit a short status update on every 30-second polling pass so the user never sees a long silent wait.
- Keep each iteration small and reviewable.
- Preserve unrelated local changes.

## Helper Scripts

- `scripts/check_codex_thumbs_up.js`
  - Exit `0` when approval is detected.
  - Exit `1` when approval is not detected.
  - Print JSON summary for logs and automation.
- `scripts/collect_codex_feedback.js`
  - Gather Codex-authored review summaries, inline comments, and discussion comments.
  - Output `markdown` (default) or `json`.

## Troubleshooting

- Read `references/gh-review-loop-reference.md` for:
  - Actor matching strategy.
  - GraphQL snippets for review-thread listing and resolution.
  - Operational guardrails for ambiguous feedback states.
